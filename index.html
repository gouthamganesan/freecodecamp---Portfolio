          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I got introduced to computers (just like most of the people, my age)
            through
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Rash">Road Rash</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my 12th grade, my CS teacher greatly inspired me to learn
            C++.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later during my college times, Ubuntu on our laboratory systems
            drawed my eyes. I quickly became a unix ricing junkie, which I have greatly
            reduced now.
          </p>
          <p>Working in the product management team, has also let me have a taste of web designign and I have picked up a few concepts through <a href="https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/">Figma's free design course</a>.</p>
          <p>Now I'm currently going through the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp</a>'s curriculam and developing ugly looking webpages.</p>
